## Introduction

The main objective of this analysis is to add value to Budweiser company
through our exploratory data analysis. We have discovered several
interesting opportunities throughout this study. We are positive that
this analysis will enhance Budweiser's strategic decision making and
open a few doors for future opportunities.

The goal of this analysis is to assess the beer and brewery market data
given to us by Budweiser Breweries and assist with the preliminary data
collection, exploratory data analysis, and analysis to identify trends
and provide advice on opportunities for a new business proposal.

**Datasets**

1.  Beers.csv: The Beers dataset contains 2,410 beers that are being
    produced in the United States along with metrics for ABV (Alcohol by
    Volume), IBU (International Bitterness Units), Style, and ounces and
    includes the Brewery ID associated with that beer.
2.  Breweries.csv: The Breweries dataset contains 558 Breweries in the
    United States along with the Brewery ID (which matches with the one
    from the Beers dataset) and which city and state it is located in.

### Preliminary Data Collection & Cleaning

```{r }
# Importing and Cleaning the data 
Beer <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BivinSadler/MSDS_6306_Doing-Data-Science/Master/Unit%208%20and%209%20Case%20Study%201/Beers.csv",header = TRUE)

Brewery <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BivinSadler/MSDS_6306_Doing-Data-Science/Master/Unit%208%20and%209%20Case%20Study%201/Breweries.csv", header = TRUE)

colnames(Beer)[5]="Brew_ID"# Renamed Brewery_id to Brew_ID so that it has the same name in both the dataframe. This will help us merge by the brewery identification
colnames(Brewery)[2] = "Brewery_Name"

# Question # 2 Merge the beer data with brewery data
beerfinal <- merge(Beer,Brewery,by.x = "Brew_ID", by.y = "Brew_ID" ) # outer merged the 2 dataframes by brewery identification
beerfinal$State <- as.factor(beerfinal$State) # changed state into factor
beerfinal$Style <- as.factor(beerfinal$Style) # changed beer style into a factor so that it can be grouped
beerfinal$Brewery <- as.factor(beerfinal$Brewery_Name) 



```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### 1. Breweries by State

Every state has at least 2 brewery, ranging from 2 (Delaware and West
Virginia) to 265 (Colorado).Washington DC also has one brewery which has
been excluded from the heat map as DC is not a state. The median
breweries across the state is 27.Regionally, West has the most breweries
with Colorado, California and Oregon in top 6.Midwest is close second
with Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin in top 10.

```{r}

#head(beerfinal)
#summary(beerfinal)
#colnames(beerfinal)
# In order to use the maps and usdata libraray, we need to remove one brewery which is in DC
grep("DC",beerfinal$State,ignore.case = TRUE) 
beerfinal[1286:1293,]
beerfinal_wodc = beerfinal[-(1286:1293),]
grep("DC",beerfinal_wodc$abb,ignore.case = TRUE) 

# remove 1 factor level of Dc to match the map
beerfinal_wodc$State <- factor(beerfinal_wodc$State, exclude = "DC") # remove 1 factor level of Dc to match the map
beerfinal_wodc$State = as.factor(beerfinal_wodc$State)


#makes a data frame with State name and abbreviation
lookup = data.frame(abb = state.abb, State = state.name)

# used stri_sub function to remove a "space" in front of the state abbreviations
beerfinal_wodc$State = stri_sub(beerfinal_wodc$State,-2)

#changed state to lower case so that it can be used to match the location(longitude,latitude)
beerfinal_wodc$State = tolower(abbr2state(beerfinal_wodc$State))

# ake one data set with state names and abb
beerheatData = count(beerfinal_wodc,State) #count up the occurrence of each state. 


colnames(beerheatData)[2] = "Breweries" #change "n" to "Breweries"
colnames(beerheatData)[1] = "region" # changed the 1st column to "region"

# Arrange the States by Breweries
beerheatData1 = arrange(beerheatData,desc(Breweries)) 

#This shows the number of brewery excluding 1 in DC
beerheatData1
#summary(beerheatData1)

# Generating a heat map
states <- map_data("state")
map.df <- merge(states,beerheatData, by="region", all.x=T)
map.df <- map.df[order(map.df$order),]
ggplot(map.df, aes(x=long,y=lat,group=group))+
  geom_polygon(aes(fill=Breweries))+
  geom_path()+ 
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours=rev(heat.colors(10)),na.value="grey90")+ggtitle("No. of Breweries by State(excluding DC)")+
  coord_map()
  
```

### 2. First 6 observations & last 6 observations of merged file

Merging was done in the first section. Observations are shown below.

```{r}
head(beerfinal, n=6)
tail(beerfinal,n=6)


```

### 3. Missing Values

We can see that there are 62 missing values in ABV (2.57%) and 1005 in
IBU (41.7%). We are not going to delete the missing values as we may
have to do data analysis on individual properties. We will use filter na
function to study any relations in future.

```{r}
summary(beerfinal)
#colSums(is.na(beerfinal))
```

```{r}
colMeans(is.na(beerfinal)) * 100

```

### 4. Median Alcohol & Bitterness

The median IBU is highest in Maine(61) followed by West Virginia(57.5)
and Florida(55). The lowest median IBU is in Wisconsin (19) followed by
Kansas(20), and Arizona(20.5). The median highest ABV is in Washington
DC and Kentucky(6.25%) closely followed by a 3 way tie between Michigan,
New Mexico, and West Virginia(6.2%). The lowest median ABV is in Utah
(4%) followed by New Jersey(4.6%).The low ABV in Utah is due to the
state regulation, where only 4% ABV was allowed in grocery stores.
However, this law changed in 2019 and currently grocery stores in Utah
can sell up-to 5% ABV.

```{r}
# 4 Median Alcohol and Bitterness Unit by State
#calculating Median for IBU
sumdata = beerfinal %>% filter(!is.na(beerfinal$IBU)) %>% group_by(State)%>% summarise(Mean=mean(IBU), Max=max(IBU), Min=min(IBU), Median=median(IBU), Std=sd(IBU))
sumdata1 = arrange(sumdata,desc(Median))
print (sumdata1, n=51)

# Median Distribution of IBU by US States
sumdata %>% ggplot(aes(x=reorder(State,-Median), y=Median)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity",width = 0.5) + xlab("US States") + ylab("IBU Median") + ggtitle("Median Distribution of IBU by US States") + theme(text = element_text(size=10),axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, hjust=1)) 



#calculating Median for ABV
sumdataabv = beerfinal %>% filter(!is.na(beerfinal$ABV)) %>% group_by(State)%>% summarise(Mean=mean(ABV), Max=max(ABV), Min=min(ABV), Median=median(ABV), Std=sd(ABV))
sumdataabv = arrange(sumdataabv,desc(Median))
print(sumdataabv, n=51)

# Median Distribution of ABV by US States

sumdataabv %>% ggplot(aes(x=reorder(State,-Median), y=Median)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity",width =0.5) + xlab("US States") + ylab("ABV Median") + ggtitle("Median Distribution of ABV by US States") + theme(text = element_text(size=10),axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, hjust=1))
```

### 5. Maximum IBU & ABV

The maximum ABV(12.8%) is Lee Hill Series Vol.5 beer from Upslope
Brewing Company in Boulder, Colorado. The maximum IBU (138) is Bitter
Bitch Imperial beer from Astoria Brewing Company located in Astoria,
Oregon.

```{r}
sumdata2 = arrange(sumdata,desc(Max))
head(sumdata2)
max_abv = beerfinal[which.max(beerfinal$IBU),]
max_abv

sumdataabv2 = arrange(sumdataabv,desc(Max))
head(sumdataabv2)
most_bitter = beerfinal[which.max(beerfinal$ABV),]
most_bitter

```

### 6. Summary of ABV

The ABV distribution is right skewed with the tail around 7 to 10 %.
There are number of factors which causes this skeweness. Some states
require higher alcohol beer to only be sold in liquor stores. This
causes breweries to restrict alcohol percent by stopping the
fermentation early.Another factor is the cost associated with higher
alcohol. Higher alcohol, in general, costs higher to produce due to the
higher fermentation time and extra raw materials.

```{r}
# 6 Summary of ABV

summary(beerfinal$ABV)
beerfinal %>% ggplot(aes(x=ABV)) + geom_histogram()+ xlab("Alcohol by Volume(ABV)") + ylab("Frequency of ABV")+ ggtitle("Alcohol by Volume Distribution")

```

### 7. Relationship between ABV & IBU

The correlation coefficient between IBU and ABV is 0.67. This evidence
suggests that there is a positive correlation between IBU and ABV. A
correlation below and over the median IBU(35) was also run. The
relationship gets worse at lower IBU (IBU \<35, R=0.25) and comparable
when IBU is higher (IBU \< 35, R = 0.64). There is an opportunity to
optimize the relationship based on the style of beer.

```{r}

# 7 Relationship between ABV and IBU using Scatterplot
beerfinal %>% filter(!is.na(beerfinal$ABV) & !is.na(beerfinal$IBU)) %>% ggplot(aes(x=IBU, y=ABV))+ geom_point() + geom_smooth(method="lm") + stat_cor(p.accuracy = 0.001) + ggtitle("Relationship between International Bitterness Unit(IBU) \n& Alcohol % by Volume (ABV)")

# Relationship between ABV and IBU using Scatterplot with IBU < & > 35 (Median IBU)
beerfinal %>% filter(!is.na(beerfinal$ABV) & !is.na(beerfinal$IBU) & IBU < 35) %>% ggplot(aes(x=IBU, y=ABV))+ geom_point() + geom_smooth(method="lm") + stat_cor(p.accuracy = 0.001) + ggtitle("Relationship between International Bitterness Unit(IBU) \n& Alcohol % by Volume (ABV) with IBU < 35 ")


beerfinal %>% filter(!is.na(beerfinal$ABV) & !is.na(beerfinal$IBU) & IBU > 35) %>% ggplot(aes(x=IBU, y=ABV))+ geom_point() + geom_smooth(method="lm") + stat_cor(p.accuracy = 0.001) + ggtitle("Relationship between International Bitterness Unit(IBU) \n& Alcohol % by Volume (ABV) with IBU > 35 ")

```

## 8. Classification of IPA & ALE Using KNN

### Filter & Clean data

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(caret)
library(class)
# filtering IPA & Ale style beers only 
both_df  <- dplyr::filter(beerfinal, grepl('IPA|Ale', beerfinal$Style))
sum(is.na(both_df))

# normalize beer style -- add type column for classification
both_df$Type <- if_else(grepl('IPA', both_df$Style), "IPA", "ALE")
head(both_df)

# remove missing values
both_clean <- remove_missing(both_df)
```

### KNN Model

```{r}

# split of 70/30 for training and test sets 
set.seed(6)
splitPerc = .70
iterations = 100 
numks = 10 

# randomly split the train and test sets

  
masterAcc = matrix(nrow = iterations, ncol=numks)

# using only IBU & ABV values & Style as the class against which knn will search 
# iterate through 100 values of k to hypertune the k parameter
for (j in 1:iterations) {
  trainIndices = sample(1:dim(both_clean)[1], round(splitPerc * dim(both_clean)[1]))
  train = both_clean[trainIndices,]
  test = both_clean[-trainIndices,]
  for (i in 1:numks) {
    classifications = knn(train[,c(4,5)], test[,c(4,5)], train$Type, prob=TRUE, k=i)
    table(classifications, test$Type)
    CM = confusionMatrix(table(classifications,test$Type)) # confusion matrix
    masterAcc[j, i] = CM$overall[1]
  }
}

MeanAcc = colMeans(masterAcc)


# plot the Mean knn value
plot(seq(1, numks, 1), MeanAcc, type="l")
which.max(MeanAcc)
max(MeanAcc)


```

Using knn classification to explore the relationship between ABV and IBU
and test whether we can accurately classify a beer as an IPA or an ALE
using these two metrics. Iterating through values of k from a range of 1
to 10, we can see from a visual inspection of the plot that the most
optimal value for k is 5. This tells us we will be looking at the 5
nearest neighbors ABV & IBU values of a specified beer in order to
determine its classification.

### Confusion Matrix

```{r}
CM
```

The confusion matrix and model statistics above is calculated from our
predictions using the k-nn classifier with k=5 and tells us our model
had an Accuracy of 86% in predicting the correct classification of beer,
which is adequate for a classification model, but there are
opportunities for optimization we can explore. The confusion matrix also
tells us that 147 Ales were predicted correctly and 13 ales were
predicted incorrectly (91.9% accuracy for Ales) and 97 IPAs were
predicted correctly and 26 IPAs incorrectly (86.2% accuracy of IPAs).

### Scatterplot of KNN Results

The scatter plot of the predicted values of Ale & IPA based on their IBU
& ABV shows us that there is a strong relationship between IBU & ABV and
the classification of Ale or IPA. As we can see, our prediction lines
for both Ales and IPas follows their respective data points well. As can
be seen from the plot, the Ale Threshold for IBU is below around 50
units and for ABV it is below around 6%. The IPA Threshold for IBU is
above around 60 units and for ABV it above around 6%. This shows us
there

```{r}
# scatter plot of the predicted values of ALE & IPA based on their IBU & ABV
test  %>% filter(!is.na(test$ABV) & !is.na(test$IBU))%>% ggplot(aes(x = ABV, IBU,color = Type)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm") + theme_dark() + xlab("Alcohol by Volume") + ylab("International Bitterness Unit")

```

```{r}
# Naive Bayes 
library(e1071)
classifications_naive = naiveBayes(train[,c(4,5)], as.factor(train$Style))
CM_nb = confusionMatrix(table(predict(classifications_naive,test[,c(4,5)]),as.factor(test$Style)))
draw_confusion_matrix(CM_nb)
```

```{r}
beerfinal <- data.frame(beerfinal[beerfinal$Category !='Other',])
beerfinal
beerfinal %>% filter(!is.na(beerfinal$ABV) & !is.na(beerfinal$IBU))%>% ggplot(aes(x=ABV, y=IBU, color = Category)) + geom_point(position = "jitter") + theme_dark()

```

```{r}
set.seed(6)
splitPerc=0.7

trainIndices = sample(1:dim(both_clean)[1], round(splitPerc * dim(both_clean)[1]))
train = both_clean[trainIndices,]
test = both_clean[-trainIndices,]

accuracies = data.frame(accuracy=numeric(100), k=numeric(100))

for (i in 1:100) { 
  classifications = knn(train[,c(4,5)], test[,c(4,5)], train$Type, prob=TRUE, k=i)
  table(test$Type,classifications)
  CM = confusionMatrix(table(test$Type,classifications))
  accuracies$accuracy[i] = CM$overall[1]
  accuracies$k[i] = i
}

accuracies$k
accuracies$accuracy

test$Result <- knn(train[,c(4,5)], test[,c(4,5)], train$Type, prob=TRUE, k=5)
CM <- confusionMatrix(table(test$Type,classifications))
CM

```

## 9. Focus on IPA and Acquisition

### Background

Budweiser's parent company is Anheuser-Busch. Anheuser-Busch owns
various popular commercial brands such as Budweiser, Bud Light, Michelob
Ultra, Natural Light etc. However, most are unaware of their acquisition
of many microbreweries within US. Most of the bigger breweries such
Anheuser-Busch, Miller, Coors etc have been strategically purchasing
shares in microbreweries over the last 20 years or so, as popularity in
microbreweries has grown. IPA is one of the most popular styles of beer
in US. With this analysis, we will propose future microbrewery
acquisition opportunities to the Budweiser's CEO and CFO, based on IPA's
ABV and IBU.

### Potential Future Acquisition

Data collected from <https://www.anheuser-busch.com/brands/>

We have collected most IPA brands from microbreweries owned by
Anheuser-Busch. Our median ABV from this dataset is 6.9 % and IBU is 50.
For comparison, the median ABV for IPA from our brewery data is 6.8% and
IBU is 70. For potential acquisition, we filtered IPA with similar hop
profile (picked 45 to 55 IBU with median 50 in the middle), slightly
lower ABV (6.2 to median 6.9%, to find an efficient and cost effective
beer). We came across 5 breweries using this filter. However, there are
only 2 breweries that are not in the states that Anheuser-Busch
operates. This is important for the new market penetration. The 2
breweries are Big Wood Brewery in MN and Abita Brewing Company in LA. We
believe that this analysis can supplement any future acquisition
decision by Anheuser-Busch.

```{r}
#data manually transferred from website into a csv file
AB_IPA = read.csv(file.choose(), header = TRUE)
head(AB_IPA)
summary(AB_IPA)

### ABV and IBU(IPA only) from the Breweries dataset

IPA_only <- dplyr::filter(both_clean, grepl('IPA', both_clean$Type))
summary(IPA_only)
valuebeer  <- IPA_only %>% filter(IBU > 45 & IBU < 55 &  ABV > 0.062 & ABV < 0.069)
valuebeer
```

## Conclusion

Based on this dataset, there is evidence to suggest that there is a
linear positive relationship between Bitterness Unit and Alcohol.
There's also evidence to suggest that this relationship differs across
different type of beer. There is a big opportunity to optimize
Bitterness Unit and Alcohol at the Budweiser breweries across US. This
optimization can be enhanced further through knn model, which showed
evidence of high accuracy in determining type of beer (IPA & Ale). The
biggest opportunity for Anheuser-Busch and Budweiser is to create a
model for micro brewery acquisition. We realize that there are multiple
parameters important for acquisition and most of them are financial. The
financial inputs can be paired alongside beer properties to create a
strategic model for Anheuser-Busch's brewery acquisition.
